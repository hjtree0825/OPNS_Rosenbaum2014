#Coding assignment based on the counterfactual analysis of Rosenbaum (2013):
#Construct the findBestLocation() function, which identifies the optimal foreign-owned supplier locations, given the location of the domestic-owned suppliers. 
#Let the expected cost of a supplier satesfying an assembly plant be a linear function of the union rate and the distance between the supplier and assembly plant. beta gives these multiplicative constants.
